# FAQ
## Where can I find the replay files?
Replay files are saved in **C:\Users\<username>\My Documents\My Games\Age Of Empires IV\playback** which should contain the replay of the last game named **temp.rec**. File > Open... should automatically open this directory. 
If Aoe4ReplayAnalyzer is running when a game ends it will save a copy of the file in C:\Users\<username>\My Documents\My Games\Age Of Empires IV\playback\replays. The filename contains the date and time, the map and the player's names for 1vs1s.
